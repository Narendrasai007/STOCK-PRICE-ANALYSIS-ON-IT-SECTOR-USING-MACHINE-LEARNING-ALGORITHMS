Stock price forecasting is an important yet challenging task, given the highly dynamic fluctuations in stock markets. This research explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict stock prices in the information technology (IT) sector. This study collects 10 years of daily stock data of (Jan 2010 - June 2020) for four major IT companies - IBM, Accenture, Nvidia, and Adobe. After data pre-processing, three predictive modeling techniques are implemented - Simple Moving Average, Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are further categorized into Simple LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and Convolutional 2D LSTM. The models are trained on 94% of the dataset and validated on the remaining 6% out-of-sample data. The Prediction accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error (RMSE).
The findings reveal that LSTM networks consistently outperform the other techniques, shows lower RMSEs across all four companies. Specifically, Bidirectional LSTM and Simple LSTM emerge as the best performing models, showing robust predictive capabilities even amidst uncertainties like the COVID-19 pandemic. This research highlights the advantages of LSTM networks in capturing nonlinear relationships and long-term dependencies in stock data. It provides data-driven insights into leveraging advanced machine learning for stock price modelling in the IT sector. This study can provide trading strategies and investment decisions for IT stocks. Further research can explore integrating LSTM networks with advanced models or using alternative data sources to improve prediction accuracy.
