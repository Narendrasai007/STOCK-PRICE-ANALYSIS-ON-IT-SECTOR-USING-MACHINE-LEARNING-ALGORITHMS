# STOCK-PRICE-ANALYSIS-ON-IT-SECTOR-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHMS

This is a research project I have accomplished during my masters Thesis at the university of Kent, The project was Stock Price Analysis on IT sector using Machine Learing Algorithms.

This is the main readme.me file will act as an information file:

This study collected 10 years of daily stock data from Jan 2010 - June 2020. The data for this project was extracted from Yahoo finance, There were 4 sets of data been used namely IBM, Accenture, Nvidia, and Adobe.
